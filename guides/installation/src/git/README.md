# Git + GitHub

Welcome to our git and github guides! Here, we'll teach you all about what github is, how to interact with it, and how it'll be useful here at UAV Austin! Admittedly, the guides below are really just scratching the surface of what's possible with git, but luckily, there's a ton of resources out there that will help guide us as the year progresses! This is just a starting point. 

A lot of the material covered here will be reiterated in each subteams bootcamp, but feel free to refer to these guides as references at any time you need. 

Here's some external links and resources that you may find helpful!
