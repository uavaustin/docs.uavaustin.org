# Rust

Rust is the language used for all obstacle and vehicle avoidance systems in the stack, in particular Pathfinder and the future VAS.

Rust is a very memory-efficient and memory-safe programming language, with great applications in low-level projects. It is a C-type language, often used for modular and object-oriented tasks. However, unlike C++, it has official documentation, standards, and a very useful compiler.


## Installation

Before installing, please make sure you refer to [this](http://docs.uavaustin.org/guides/installation/getting-started/index.html) page to make sure your computer is set up first. When using Rust, it is recommended that you use Linux. Dual boot or WSL is strongly encouraged for Windows uers.

For installation, please refer to the [Rust installation page](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install).

## Resources

### Getting Started

For setting up and using the basics of Rust and Cargo, use this [this guide](https://www.rust-lang.org/learn/get-started).

### Rust Documentation

Rust has a lot of great documentation resources. The first and best way to learn Rust is using [The book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/). Please refer to the book for basic info about the language and some of its mechanics. 

Another good resource is [Rust by example](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/rust-by-example/index.html). Rust by example outlines different use-cases of different features of Rust. This is often a great way to get a grasp of the range of the features which Rust allows.

### Other Resources

Other useful resources for learning are:
* [Rustlings](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustlings/), a repository of coding exercises for new rustaceans.
* The official [style guide](https://doc.rust-lang.org/1.0.0/style/style/naming/README.html) for Rust.
* The [standard library](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/index.html) documentation.
