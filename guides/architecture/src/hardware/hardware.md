# The Hardware of Software

Despite boasting a $0 budget, we do suffer expenditures from time to time, like having to give the software members some pizza from time to time so they get cracking. We also buy chips, although they tend not to be edible.
Several flavors of chips we have purchased are described below, in order of succession.

## Aircraft Hardware

### On-Board Computer

- Raspberry Pi 2 (although the one we used was technically Rahul's - shhh!)
  - We've had a couple burn out -- that's why we don't recommend them anymore.
- Raspberry Pi Zero
  - It doesn't support Docker very well. Mostly garbage.
- ODROID
  - A cheap Korean knockoff of the Raspberry Pi. (I mean, it's not *really* a knockoff, but it's easier to describe it as if it were.)
- NVIDIA Jetson TX2
  - On-board; intended to be a high-performance replacement to the above.
- NVIDIA Jetson AGX Xavier
  - The successor to the TX2.

### Camera

- Sony Î±6000
  - We thought it was a good idea, because other teams used this camera. It wasn't.
- Z-CAM E1
  - A fast block camera with an esoteric HTTP API that embeds error codes inside JSON objects (with no content-type, mind you) instead of using HTTP error codes like any decent API
  - It also gets really hot and has a known 10% chance of catching on fire.
    - I'm just kidding. We don't know about any battery fires from this camera.

## Ground Hardware

- A weirdly specced ASRock server rack
- Consumer-grade router
- Rocket AC
  - A long-range 802.11ac transceiver.

## Naming Convention

These devices tend to be named after characters in *The Office*. Please continue the tradition so that Bradley can feel proud.

Also, please remind <abbr title="Power and Electronics">P&E</abbr> not to make an unholy mess with the wiring, as they always do.
