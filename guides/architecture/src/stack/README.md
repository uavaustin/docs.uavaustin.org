# Software Stack

This section of the document serves mainly to discuss the present-day software stack, specifically at the time that Bradley left it. It is mostly from my (Bennett's) subjective point of view.

But first, a word about Bradley. Aside from religious beliefs such as the choice of text editor and indentation, he had a reason for even seemingly small details. And unlike most software members, he also had copious amounts of free time to spare for working on UAVA code. This was his passion project, and he was willing to experiment injecting industry-standard practices into the project. I do not expect anyone to have anywhere near the amount of time as he did to sink into the software stack.

Despite this, Bradley will not haunt you in your sleep if you change his code. Simply be conscious about what you are trying to do.
