# Introduction

Welcome to UAV Austin's architecture guide and (occassionally) history book.

This guide is intended to familiarize you with the workings of the software team, its interactions with the hardware team, and the current implemented architecture of the software stack.

Note that this book will *always* be a work-in-progress. If you have implemented new parts of the architecture that you are ready to document, or have new history to record, do not be afraid to edit the docs.

Check out our 2019 [Technical Paper](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1cukH_5obn0dbvtqm8swrvJMw136q-smBsOf-7hlikVU/edit?usp=sharing) for a really in-depth, wholistic look at the architecture of our plane.
