# Image Transformation

In this section, we will explore a few of the fundemental image processing functions we
need to generate synthetic data for our machine learning models. We must use synthetic
data because training these models takes thousands of images, and we do not have the 
capacity to capture these in reality.

We'll use [`PIL`](https://pillow.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) to perform most of the work,
however there are other noteable packages available, such as OpenCV.
